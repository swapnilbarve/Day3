1) Difference between Axios and fetch?

Ans===>  Axios

Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node.js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser and it supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6. 

Axios is a stand-alone third party package that can be easily installed.

Axios performs automatic transforms of JSON data.

Axios allows cancelling request and request timeout.

Axios has the ability to intercept HTTP requests.

Axios has built-in support for download progress.



fetch

The Fetch API provides a fetch() method defined on the window object. It also provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline (requests and responses). 

Fetch is built into most modern browsers; no installation is required as such.

Fetch is a two-step process when handling JSON data- first, to make the actual request; second, to call the .json() method on the response.

Fetch, by default, doesnâ€™t provide a way to intercept requests.

Fetch does not support upload progress.
